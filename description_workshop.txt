[h1]Grid Block![/h1]
Explore the world where [b]everything is locked by default![/b] Inspired by a popular Minecraft data pack [b]Chunklock,[/b] this mod provides a unique challenge in which you have to get lots of bizarre and unique materials, just to... [i]set foot on the new land?[/i] But listen, I tried making it less tedious and a lot more fun with the help of [b]Surprises [/b]- random occurrences, which could happen when you unlock a chunk! But be careful, some do come with [b]terrible consequences...[/b]

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list] [*] Enjoy a [b]varied [/b]and [b]sometimes weird[/b] pool of items, required for unlocks!
[*] If you're feeling stuck, you can [b]reroll any chunk[/b] you don't like!
[*] Obtain rerolls by [b]defeating bosses[/b] or [b]unlocking more chunks![/b]
[*] [b]Growing difficulty[/b] to make sure the progress doesn't feel boring!
[*] [b]40+ funny random occurrences[/b] to experience!
